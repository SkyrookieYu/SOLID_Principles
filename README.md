# SOLID Design Principles

* #### [Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/tal95shah/SOLID_Principles/tree/master/SingleResponsibility)<br/>
* #### [Interface Segregation Principle](https://github.com/tal95shah/SOLID_Principles/tree/master/InterfaceSegregation)<br/>
* #### [Open Closed Principle](https://github.com/tal95shah/SOLID_Principles/tree/master/OpenClosed)<br/>

## What happens if we don't use SOLID?

* Tight coupling occurs
* Duplication of code
* Unknown issues in application development lifecycle
* requires time to do modification in code
* code not testable

<hr />

## Why use SOLID?

* reduces complexity of code.
* reusability
* reduces error
* increase readability, extensibility
* better testability
* reduces tight coupling


## Solution to successful development of app depends on?

* Architecture (e.g MVC)
* Design Principles (e.g SOLID)
* Design Patterns (e.g Singleton)
