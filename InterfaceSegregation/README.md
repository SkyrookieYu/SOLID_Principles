# Interface Segregation Principle

## Definition

Single large interface must be divided into small, relevant, cohesive interfaces so that clients can know about interfaces that are relevant to them.

## Motivation

* Client should depend on only those interfaces that they use, they should not be forced to implement any functionality that is of no use to them.
